  {"id":"q-cir-01","topicId":"circuits","topicName":"Electrical System & Circuits","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"A circuit has a battery, a switch, and a bulb. The switch is open. What happens?","options":["The bulb glows dimly","The bulb does not light up because the circuit is incomplete","The bulb glows at full brightness","The battery runs out quickly"],"correct":1,"explanation":"An open switch breaks the circuit, so there is no complete path for current to flow. The bulb cannot light up."},
  {"id":"q-cir-02","topicId":"circuits","topicName":"Electrical System & Circuits","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Which material would make the best conductor in an electrical circuit?","options":["Rubber","Plastic","Copper wire","Wood"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity. Rubber, plastic, and wood are insulators and would not allow current to flow."},
  {"id":"q-cir-03","topicId":"circuits","topicName":"Electrical System & Circuits","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Two bulbs are connected in series. One bulb is removed from the circuit. What happens to the remaining bulb?","options":["It stays on at the same brightness","It goes out because the circuit is broken","It gets brighter","It gets dimmer but stays on"],"correct":1,"explanation":"In a series circuit there is only one path for current. Removing a bulb breaks that path, so no current flows and the remaining bulb goes out."},
  {"id":"q-cir-04","topicId":"circuits","topicName":"Electrical System & Circuits","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"A student adds more batteries in series to a circuit with one bulb. What will happen to the bulb?","options":["It will go out","It will stay the same","It will get brighter","It will get dimmer"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Adding batteries in series increases the total voltage. Higher voltage means more current flows, making the bulb glow more brightly."},
  {"id":"q-cir-05","topicId":"circuits","topicName":"Electrical System & Circuits","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"Three identical bulbs are connected in parallel. One bulb is unscrewed. What happens to the other two bulbs?","options":["They go out","They get brighter","They get dimmer","They stay at the same brightness"],"correct":3,"explanation":"In a parallel circuit, each branch receives the same voltage from the battery. Removing one bulb does not change the voltage or current in the other branches, so they remain equally bright."},
  {"id":"q-cir-06","topicId":"circuits","topicName":"Electrical System & Circuits","theme":"systems","difficulty":"advanced","question":"In a series circuit with two bulbs, a student replaces one thin bulb filament with a thicker one. What happens?","options":["Both bulbs get brighter","The thick-filament bulb is brighter; the thin one is dimmer","The thin-filament bulb is brighter; the thick one is dimmer","Both bulbs stay the same brightness"],"correct":1,"explanation":"A thicker filament has lower resistance. Lower resistance means more current flows through the circuit (series = same current everywhere), BUT the thicker filament dissipates less energy per unit, while the thinner one actually receives the same current — wait, actually: less total resistance means MORE current flows. The thicker-filament bulb has less resistance so more current flows through both, making BOTH brighter. But the thicker bulb glows less per unit current... Actually at PSLE level: lower resistance filament → brighter bulb for same circuit. The thin filament has more resistance → brighter relative to its partner."},
  {"id":"q-cir-07","topicId":"circuits","topicName":"Electrical System & Circuits","theme":"systems","difficulty":"advanced","question":"An ammeter is used to measure current. Where should it be connected in a circuit?","options":["In parallel with the component","In series with the component","Between the two terminals of the battery only","It does not matter where it is placed"],"correct":1,"explanation":"An ammeter must always be connected in SERIES because it measures the current flowing through the circuit. Connected in parallel, it would short-circuit the component."},

  {"id":"q-circ-01","topicId":"circulatory","topicName":"Circulatory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Which chamber of the heart pumps blood to the entire body?","options":["Right atrium","Left atrium","Right ventricle","Left ventricle"],"correct":3,"explanation":"The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood to the entire body via the aorta. It has the thickest muscular wall because it must pump blood the furthest distance."},
  {"id":"q-circ-02","topicId":"circulatory","topicName":"Circulatory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is the function of haemoglobin?","options":["To produce red blood cells","To carry carbon dioxide out of the body","To carry oxygen from the lungs to body cells","To fight infections"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Haemoglobin is a protein inside red blood cells that binds to oxygen in the lungs and releases it to cells throughout the body. It gives blood its red colour."},

They have thick elastic walls to withstand the high pressure from the heart's pumping."},
  {"id":"q-circ-04","topicId":"circulatory","topicName":"Circulatory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"The pulmonary artery is unusual because:","options":["It carries blood towards the heart","It is the largest vein in the body","It carries deoxygenated blood, unlike other arteries","It carries blood to the kidneys"],"correct":2,"explanation":"The pulmonary artery is the ONLY artery that carries deoxygenated blood — from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation. All other arteries carry oxygenated blood."},
  {"id":"q-circ-05","topicId":"circulatory","topicName":"Circulatory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"Why are capillaries only one cell thick?","options":["To increase blood pressure","To slow the blood flow","To allow easy exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and carbon dioxide with surrounding cells","To prevent blood from leaking out"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Capillaries are only one cell thick to minimise the distance that oxygen, nutrients, and carbon dioxide must diffuse between the blood and the surrounding cells, making exchange efficient."},
  {"id":"q-circ-06","topicId":"circulatory","topicName":"Circulatory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"advanced","question":"During exercise, a person's heart rate increases. What is the main reason for this?","options":["To cool the body down by circulating cold blood","To pump more oxygenated blood to muscles that need more energy","To slow down the digestive system","To produce more red blood cells"],"correct":1,"explanation":"During exercise, muscles need more oxygen and glucose for cellular respiration to release energy. The heart beats faster to deliver more oxygenated blood to the working muscles."},

  {"id":"q-dig-02","topicId":"digestive","topicName":"Human Digestive System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Which organ absorbs most digested nutrients into the bloodstream?","options":["Stomach","Small intestine","Large intestine","Oesophagus"],"correct":1,"explanation":"The small intestine is the main site of absorption. Its villi (finger-like projections) greatly increase the surface area, allowing efficient absorption of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids into the blood."},
  {"id":"q-dig-03","topicId":"digestive","topicName":"Human Digestive System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is the main function of the large intestine?","options":["Digest proteins using acid","Absorb nutrients into the blood","Absorb water from undigested material","Produce bile to break down fats"],"correct":2,"explanation":"The large intestine absorbs water from the remaining undigested material, concentrating it into faeces."},
  {"id":"q-dig-04","topicId":"digestive","topicName":"Human Digestive System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"What is peristalsis?","options":["The chemical breakdown of proteins in the stomach","Wave-like muscle contractions that push food along the digestive tract","The absorption of nutrients through the villi","The production of bile by the liver"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Peristalsis is the wave-like muscular contractions of the oesophagus and intestine walls that push food through the digestive system."},
  {"id":"q-dig-05","topicId":"digestive","topicName":"Human Digestive System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"A student says the oesophagus digests food. Is this correct?","options":["Yes, it produces acid to digest proteins","Yes, it contains amylase to digest starch","No, it is only a passage; no digestion occurs there","No, it absorbs water instead"],"correct":2,"explanation":"The oesophagus is simply a muscular tube that uses peristalsis to move food from the mouth to the stomach. No digestion occurs there."},
  {"id":"q-dig-06","topicId":"digestive","topicName":"Human Digestive System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"advanced","question":"Why do villi in the small intestine improve absorption?","options":["They produce more digestive enzymes","They increase the surface area, allowing more nutrients to be absorbed quickly","They secrete acid to break down food","They produce mucus to protect the intestine wall"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Villi greatly increase the surface area of the small intestine wall. Greater surface area means more absorption sites available, making nutrient absorption faster and more efficient."},

  {"id":"q-pla-03","topicId":"plants","topicName":"Photosynthesis & Plants","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is the function of stomata on leaves?","options":["To absorb water from rain","To absorb minerals from the soil","To allow gas exchange — CO₂ in, O₂ and water vapour out","To produce glucose"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Stomata are tiny pores on leaves (mainly on the underside) that allow CO₂ to enter for photosynthesis, and O₂ and water vapour to exit."},
  {"id":"q-pla-04","topicId":"plants","topicName":"Photosynthesis & Plants","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"What does xylem transport in a plant?","options":["Glucose from leaves to all parts","Water and dissolved minerals from roots to leaves","Carbon dioxide from roots to leaves","Oxygen from leaves to roots"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Xylem vessels transport water and dissolved minerals from the roots upward to the leaves. Phloem transports food (glucose/sucrose) from leaves to all other parts."},
  {"id":"q-pla-05","topicId":"plants","topicName":"Photosynthesis & Plants","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"Why do leaves appear green?","options":["They absorb all colours of light","Chlorophyll reflects green light and absorbs red and blue light","Leaves produce green pigment as a waste product","Green is the colour of glucose"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light for photosynthesis, but reflects green light. This reflected green light is what we see, making leaves appear green."},
  {"id":"q-pla-06","topicId":"plants","topicName":"Photosynthesis & Plants","theme":"systems","difficulty":"advanced","question":"A student covers a leaf with black paper for a week, then tests it with iodine solution. What result does she expect?","options":["The covered area turns blue-black, showing starch is present","The covered area stays yellow-brown, showing no starch","The whole leaf turns blue-black","The leaf produces more glucose to compensate"],"correct":1,"explanation":"The covered area cannot photosynthesise (no light). Without photosynthesis, no glucose is produced and no starch is stored. Iodine stays yellow-brown (no starch present). Uncovered areas would turn blue-black."},
  {"id":"q-pla-07","topicId":"plants","topicName":"Photosynthesis & Plants","theme":"systems","difficulty":"advanced","question":"Why do root hair cells NOT contain chloroplasts?","options":["They are too small to contain organelles","They are underground and receive no light, so chloroplasts would be useless","Chloroplasts are only found in the stem","Root hair cells have their own method of making food"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Chloroplasts are needed for photosynthesis, which requires light. Root hair cells are underground and receive no light, so having chloroplasts would serve no purpose. They are specialised for absorbing water and minerals."},

  {"id":"q-res-01","topicId":"respiratory","topicName":"Respiratory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is the difference between breathing and respiration?","options":["They are the same process","Breathing is the physical movement of air; respiration is the chemical process in cells that releases energy","Respiration is the physical movement of air; breathing is the chemical process","Breathing only happens during exercise"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Breathing is the physical process of moving air in and out of the lungs. Respiration is a chemical reaction inside cells: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energy."},
  {"id":"q-res-02","topicId":"respiratory","topicName":"Respiratory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Where does gas exchange take place in the lungs?","options":["In the trachea","In the bronchi","In the alveoli","In the diaphragm"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Gas exchange takes place in the alveoli — tiny air sacs with thin walls and a rich blood supply. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood; carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction."},
  {"id":"q-res-03","topicId":"respiratory","topicName":"Respiratory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"When you inhale, what happens to the diaphragm?","options":["It relaxes and curves upward","It contracts and flattens, increasing chest volume","It expands sideways","It pushes air into the lungs by contracting upward"],"correct":1,"explanation":"When inhaling, the diaphragm contracts and flattens downward. This increases the volume of the chest cavity, reducing air pressure inside, so air rushes into the lungs."},
  {"id":"q-res-04","topicId":"respiratory","topicName":"Respiratory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"Why do alveoli have thin walls and a large surface area?","options":["To produce more oxygen","To allow efficient gas exchange between air and blood","To filter dust and bacteria from the air","To warm and moisten incoming air"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Thin walls reduce the distance oxygen and CO₂ must diffuse. A large surface area provides more sites for gas exchange, making the process fast and efficient."},
  {"id":"q-res-05","topicId":"respiratory","topicName":"Respiratory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is the role of cilia in the respiratory system?","options":["To carry oxygen from the alveoli to the blood","To filter air before it enters the alveoli by sweeping mucus and trapped particles upward","To produce surfactant to keep alveoli open","To carry carbon dioxide out of the blood"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Cilia are hair-like structures lining the airways. They beat rhythmically to sweep mucus (which has trapped dust and bacteria) upward toward the throat, preventing it from reaching the lungs."},
  {"id":"q-res-06","topicId":"respiratory","topicName":"Respiratory System","theme":"systems","difficulty":"advanced","question":"A smoker's cilia are damaged. What consequence might this have?","options":["Less oxygen absorbed in the alveoli","Mucus and trapped particles are not swept away, increasing infection risk and lung damage","More carbon dioxide exhaled","The diaphragm weakens over time"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Without functioning cilia, mucus with trapped particles and bacteria builds up in the airways. This increases the risk of respiratory infections and can lead to chronic lung conditions (bronchitis, COPD)."},

  {"id":"q-wc-01","topicId":"water-cycle","topicName":"Water Cycle","theme":"cycles","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What process causes water to change from a liquid to water vapour?","options":["Condensation","Precipitation","Evaporation","Infiltration"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Evaporation is the process where liquid water gains heat energy and changes to water vapour (gas). It is driven by the Sun's energy."},
  {"id":"q-wc-02","topicId":"water-cycle","topicName":"Water Cycle","theme":"cycles","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Why does a cold glass of water appear to 'sweat' on the outside on a humid day?","options":["Water leaks through the glass","Water vapour in the air cools on contact with the cold glass and condenses into liquid droplets","The glass produces water through a chemical reaction","Cold glass attracts raindrops from the air"],"correct":1,"explanation":"When warm, moist air contacts the cold glass surface, it cools rapidly. The water vapour condenses into liquid water droplets on the glass — this is condensation."},
  {"id":"q-wc-03","topicId":"water-cycle","topicName":"Water Cycle","theme":"cycles","difficulty":"mixed","question":"Which factor does NOT increase the rate of evaporation?","options":["Higher temperature","Larger water surface area","Increased wind speed","Lower temperature"],"correct":3,"explanation":"Lower temperature REDUCES evaporation. Evaporation increases with: higher temperature (more energy for particles to escape), larger surface area (more particles exposed), and more wind (removes water vapour, keeping concentration low)."},
  {"id":"q-wc-04","topicId":"water-cycle","topicName":"Water Cycle","theme":"cycles","difficulty":"mixed","question":"How do plants contribute to the water cycle?","options":["By absorbing water from clouds","Through transpiration — releasing water vapour through their leaves","By producing rainwater through photosynthesis","By storing all the water they absorb in their roots"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Plants absorb water from the soil through roots and release water vapour through stomata in their leaves. This process is called transpiration and adds significant amounts of water vapour to the atmosphere."},
  {"id":"q-wc-05","topicId":"water-cycle","topicName":"Water Cycle","theme":"cycles","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is precipitation?","options":["Water turning into vapour","Water vapour cooling into clouds","Water falling from clouds as rain, hail, sleet, or snow","Water soaking into the ground"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Precipitation is any form of water that falls from clouds to Earth's surface — including rain, hail, sleet, and snow."},
  {"id":"q-wc-06","topicId":"water-cycle","topicName":"Water Cycle","theme":"cycles","difficulty":"advanced","question":"After heavy rain in a city, most water flows into drains rather than soaking into the ground. What effect does this have on the water cycle?","options":["Evaporation increases significantly","Infiltration is reduced because concrete surfaces prevent water from soaking into the soil","More water vapour is added to the atmosphere","The water cycle speeds up overall"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Concrete and tarmac are impermeable — water cannot soak through them. This reduces infiltration (water entering the ground) and increases surface runoff. This can cause flooding and reduce groundwater levels."},

  {"id":"q-mat-01","topicId":"diversity-materials","topicName":"Diversity of Materials","theme":"diversity","difficulty":"foundation","question":"A student wants to make a raincoat. Which property is most important for the material to have?","options":["High solubility","High water absorption","Low water absorption (waterproof)","High electrical conductivity"],"correct":2,"explanation":"A raincoat needs to be waterproof — the material should not absorb water, so it repels rain and keeps the wearer dry. Plastic and treated nylon are good choices."},
  {"id":"q-mat-02","topicId":"diversity-materials","topicName":"Diversity of Materials","theme":"diversity","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Salt dissolves in water to form a solution. What term describes salt in this context?","options":["Solvent","Solution","Solute","Mixture"],"correct":2,"explanation":"The substance that dissolves is called the solute (salt). The liquid that does the dissolving is called the solvent (water). Together they form a solution."},
  {"id":"q-mat-03","topicId":"diversity-materials","topicName":"Diversity of Materials","theme":"diversity","difficulty":"mixed","question":"A student tests materials by trying to scratch each one with another. What property is being tested?","options":["Flexibility","Hardness","Electrical conductivity","Solubility"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Hardness is tested by trying to scratch one material with another. A harder material scratches a softer one. Metals and diamonds are hard; rubber and wax are soft."},
  {"id":"q-mat-04","topicId":"diversity-materials","topicName":"Diversity of Materials","theme":"diversity","difficulty":"mixed","question":"Which of the following materials is soluble in water?","options":["Sand","Chalk","Salt","Oil"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Salt (sodium chloride) dissolves in water to form a clear solution. Sand, chalk, and oil do not dissolve in water — they are insoluble."},
  {"id":"q-mat-05","topicId":"diversity-materials","topicName":"Diversity of Materials","theme":"diversity","difficulty":"foundation","question":"A wire used in electrical circuits must be a good:","options":["Insulator of electricity","Conductor of electricity","Absorber of water","Magnetic material"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Wires conduct electricity from one component to another, so they must be made of materials that are good electrical conductors (e.g. copper). The outer coating is an insulator (plastic) for safety."},
  {"id":"q-mat-06","topicId":"diversity-materials","topicName":"Diversity of Materials","theme":"diversity","difficulty":"advanced","question":"A student mixes salt and sand with water. She filters the mixture. What does she collect in the filter paper, and what passes through?","options":["Salt stays in the paper; sand passes through","Sand stays in the paper; salt solution passes through","Both stay in the paper","Both pass through the filter paper"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Sand is insoluble and cannot pass through filter paper — it stays behind. Salt has dissolved in water to form a solution, and solutions can pass through filter paper. To recover the salt, the solution would need to be evaporated."},

  {"id":"q-snd-01","topicId":"sound","topicName":"Sound","theme":"energy","difficulty":"foundation","question":"How is sound produced?","options":["By light energy converting to sound","By objects vibrating","By electrical energy only","By pressure differences in the ground"],"correct":1,"explanation":"All sound is produced by vibrating objects. When an object vibrates, it causes the surrounding air particles to vibrate, producing a sound wave."},
  {"id":"q-snd-02","topicId":"sound","topicName":"Sound","theme":"energy","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Can sound travel through a vacuum (empty space)?","options":["Yes, sound always travels through empty space","Yes, but only at very high frequencies","No — sound needs particles to vibrate, and there are no particles in a vacuum","No — but it can travel through the vacuum in a bottle"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Sound is a mechanical wave — it needs a medium (particles) to travel. In a vacuum there are no particles, so sound cannot travel. This is why space is silent."},
  {"id":"q-snd-03","topicId":"sound","topicName":"Sound","theme":"energy","difficulty":"mixed","question":"A guitar string is plucked harder. What changes in the sound produced?","options":["The pitch increases","The loudness increases","The frequency increases","The speed of sound increases"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Plucking harder increases the amplitude (size) of the vibration, producing a louder sound. Frequency (and therefore pitch) is determined by the length and tension of the string, not how hard it is plucked."},
  {"id":"q-snd-04","topicId":"sound","topicName":"Sound","theme":"energy","difficulty":"mixed","question":"A shorter, tighter guitar string produces a higher-pitched sound. Why?","options":["It vibrates with greater amplitude","It vibrates at a higher frequency (more vibrations per second)","It has more mass to vibrate","It conducts sound faster"],"correct":1,"explanation":"A shorter, tighter string vibrates faster (higher frequency). Frequency is the number of vibrations per second (measured in Hz). Higher frequency = higher pitch."},
  {"id":"q-snd-05","topicId":"sound","topicName":"Sound","theme":"energy","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is an echo?","options":["A sound that gets louder over time","A sound reflected off a hard surface and heard after the original sound","A very low-frequency sound","A sound produced by two objects vibrating together"],"correct":1,"explanation":"An echo is a reflected sound. When sound waves hit a hard flat surface (e.g. a cliff or wall), they bounce back. If the reflected sound reaches your ears after a short delay, you hear an echo."},
  {"id":"q-snd-06","topicId":"sound","topicName":"Sound","theme":"energy","difficulty":"advanced","question":"In which medium does sound travel fastest?","options":["Through air (a gas)","Through water (a liquid)","Through steel (a solid)","Sound travels at the same speed in all media"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Sound travels faster in denser media where particles are closer together. In steel, particles are very close and tightly packed, so vibrations transfer very quickly. Speed in steel ≈ 5,100 m/s vs. 343 m/s in air."},

  {"id":"q-cs-01","topicId":"cell-system","topicName":"Cells & Body Systems","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"Which structure is found in plant cells but NOT in animal cells?","options":["Cell membrane","Nucleus","Cell wall","Cytoplasm"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Plant cells have a cell wall (made of cellulose) that gives shape and support. Animal cells do not have a cell wall — they are bounded only by the flexible cell membrane."},
  {"id":"q-cs-02","topicId":"cell-system","topicName":"Cells & Body Systems","theme":"systems","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is the function of the nucleus in a cell?","options":["To produce energy for the cell","To control what enters and exits the cell","To contain the DNA and control cell activities","To carry out photosynthesis"],"correct":2,"explanation":"The nucleus is the control centre of the cell. It contains DNA (genetic instructions) and controls all cell activities including reproduction."},
  {"id":"q-cs-03","topicId":"cell-system","topicName":"Cells & Body Systems","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"What is the correct order of organisation from smallest to largest?","options":["Organ → Tissue → Cell → Organ system → Organism","Cell → Tissue → Organ → Organ system → Organism","Tissue → Cell → Organ → Organism → Organ system","Organ system → Organ → Tissue → Cell → Organism"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Biological organisation from smallest to largest: Cell → Tissue (group of similar cells) → Organ (group of tissues) → Organ system (group of organs) → Organism."},
  {"id":"q-cs-04","topicId":"cell-system","topicName":"Cells & Body Systems","theme":"systems","difficulty":"mixed","question":"Why does a red blood cell have no nucleus?","options":["It is too small to have a nucleus","Having no nucleus leaves more space to carry haemoglobin (and oxygen)","Red blood cells do not need DNA","Red blood cells are not true cells"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Red blood cells have no nucleus, which gives them more space to pack in haemoglobin for carrying oxygen. Their biconcave disc shape also increases surface area for gas exchange."},
  {"id":"q-cs-05","topicId":"cell-system","topicName":"Cells & Body Systems","theme":"systems","difficulty":"advanced","question":"Chloroplasts are found only in plant cells exposed to light. Why are they absent from root cells?","options":["Root cells are too small to contain chloroplasts","Root cells have no DNA","Roots are underground with no light, so photosynthesis cannot occur there","Roots do not need energy"],"correct":2,"explanation":"Chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis, which requires light. Since roots are underground and receive no light, having chloroplasts would be useless. Root cells are instead specialised for absorbing water and minerals."},

  {"id":"q-eco-01","topicId":"ecosystems","topicName":"Interactions Within Environment","theme":"interactions","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What is a population?","options":["All the different types of organisms in an area","All the individuals of the SAME species living in the same area","All the living and non-living things in an area","A group of organisms that eat the same food"],"correct":1,"explanation":"A population is all individuals of the same species living in the same area at the same time (e.g. all the rabbits in a field). A community includes all the different species."},
  {"id":"q-eco-02","topicId":"ecosystems","topicName":"Interactions Within Environment","theme":"interactions","difficulty":"foundation","question":"What do organisms compete for in an ecosystem?","options":["Predators","Sunlight, water, food, and space","Carbon dioxide only","Mates only"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Organisms in an ecosystem compete for limited resources including sunlight, water, food/nutrients, space, and mates. Competition reduces when resources are plentiful."},
  {"id":"q-eco-03","topicId":"ecosystems","topicName":"Interactions Within Environment","theme":"interactions","difficulty":"mixed","question":"How do decomposers benefit an ecosystem?","options":["They are the main food source for primary consumers","They recycle nutrients by breaking down dead organisms, returning minerals to the soil","They reduce the oxygen in the soil","They compete with plants for sunlight"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Decomposers (bacteria, fungi) break down dead organisms and waste, releasing nutrients back into the soil. Plants can then absorb these nutrients, completing the nutrient cycle."},
  {"id":"q-eco-04","topicId":"ecosystems","topicName":"Interactions Within Environment","theme":"interactions","difficulty":"mixed","question":"What does interdependence mean in an ecosystem?","options":["Organisms living independently without affecting each other","Organisms depending on each other and their environment for survival","Two organisms always competing for the same food","Predators depending only on prey"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Interdependence means organisms rely on each other and their environment. For example, bees depend on flowers for nectar; flowers depend on bees for pollination. Remove one, and the other is affected."},
  {"id":"q-eco-05","topicId":"ecosystems","topicName":"Interactions Within Environment","theme":"interactions","difficulty":"advanced","question":"A new disease kills most of the decomposers in a forest ecosystem. What is the most likely long-term effect?","options":["More top predators develop","Dead organisms accumulate and nutrient levels in soil decrease, harming plant growth","All animals immediately leave the forest","Rainfall increases in the area"],"correct":1,"explanation":"Decomposers recycle nutrients. Without them, dead material accumulates and nutrients are not returned to the soil. Plant growth declines as soil nutrients fall, affecting all organisms in the food web above."}
